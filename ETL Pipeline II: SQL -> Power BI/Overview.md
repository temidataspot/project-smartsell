# ðŸ”— Phase 5: Building a Data Pipeline from MySQL to Power BI

This stage of the **SmartSell** project focuses on creating a seamless pipeline to visualize our forecasted and historical sales data in **Power BI**, directly from our **MySQL database**. This integration ensures near real-time reporting and interactive dashboards for decision-makers.

---

## ðŸ§° Environment Setup

To begin, the required tools were set up to enable the MySQLâ€“Power BI connection:

- Installed the **MySQL ODBC 64-bit Connector** to match the Power BI version.
- Opened the **ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit)** using `Win + R` â†’ `odbcad32`.

---

## ðŸ§© Creating a System DSN

A new **System Data Source Name (DSN)** was created:

- Selected the `MySQL ODBC 8.0 Unicode Driver`.
- Entered connection details: Data Source Name, TCP/IP Server, Port, Username, Password, and selected the database (e.g., `smartsell_db`).
- Tested the connection successfully.

---

## ðŸ’» Configuring via Command Prompt

To ensure driver compatibility and access credentials:

- Opened **Command Prompt** to configure the driver manually.
- Ensured username matches the ODBC setup.

---

## ðŸ“Š Connecting in Power BI

Once the ODBC driver was configured:

- Opened **Power BI**, clicked **Get Data â†’ ODBC**.
- Selected the system DSN name created earlier.
- Entered MySQL credentials again when prompted.
- Successfully accessed and previewed the MySQL tables.

---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Transformations in Power Query

- Loaded the data into **Power Query Editor** for cleaning and transformation.
- This step prepares the data for visualizations such as:
  - Forecast trend tracking
  - Year-over-year sales comparison
  - Store-wise performance dashboards

## âœ… Summary

At this stage:

- A **live data pipeline** from MySQL to Power BI has been established.
- Power BI can now query and visualize updated data from the database.
- The setup paves the way for interactive reporting and executive dashboards that can evolve as new sales data becomes available.
